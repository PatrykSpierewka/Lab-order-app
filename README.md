# Lab-order-app
This application integrates patient, laboratory, and doctor interfaces, each requiring user registration and login for access. Patients have the capability to initiate orders for blood laboratory tests through their individual accounts. They can select specific types of blood test packages offered by the laboratory. Once a test order is placed, laboratory personnel receive the request, perform the tests, and record the results within the system. This ensures that the laboratory's execution of the tests is accurately documented. Doctors can view details regarding which patient ordered which specific test and access the results recorded by the laboratory staff. They are empowered to add detailed notes, diagnoses, or medical interpretations relevant to the patient's condition and the specific test performed. Importantly, the application facilitates transparency and accountability across all stages of the testing process. Patients can see which laboratory staff member conducted their test and which doctor provided the medical commentary. Laboratory personnel have visibility into which patient ordered which type of blood test package. Similarly, doctors have access to comprehensive information, including which patient ordered which test and which laboratory staff member conducted and documented the results.
